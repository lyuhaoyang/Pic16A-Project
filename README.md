Pic16A Class project: Predict College Basketball Match

Group Members: Wei-Jen Lee, Haoyang Lyu, Adam Traut

Description: our project uses the college basketball match data in year 2020 to learn about the performance of each team and predicts their rankings as well as the winner of the match

Python package: numpy 1.21.5, pandas 1.4.2, matplotlib 3.5.1 and random

Demo File: ![1670800953059](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119776543/206935032-a6733060-da44-4497-a411-91d2b0af692c.png)


Scope and Limitation: the code can similarly be applied to predict the outcome of other sport matches like football, soccer etc, with modification of parameters and class definition. However it cannot automatically generate the desired parameters and requires the user to have a relatively good understanding of the specific sports to use.
